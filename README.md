*Features*


It tracks the time automatically without user intervention and it is made to be non-invasive giving you multiple options to customize it.
Daily Time Tracking: Along with the total time spent it can also show you the time spent on the current day
On Screen Timer: It can display the Total time spent on the Unity Scene view and you can choose where (top right, top left, bottom right..etc)
Smart timer: it only counts the time the editor is being rendered on the screen so if you have a fullscreen windows that covers Unity the time will pause, same thing if you minimize unity.


*How to use*

Import the plugin to your Unity project, it's recommended to create a folder dedicated to editor scripts like Assets/Editor/AxTimeTracker.cs
Done!
